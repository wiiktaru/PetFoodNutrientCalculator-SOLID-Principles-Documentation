## Description
The Pet Food Nutrient Calculator is a tool designed to help calculate the nutritional content of pet's food. It supports dogs and cats, and when ready provides detailed nutrient information to ensure a balanced diet.

With this project I aim to practice SOLID principless, code documentation and version control.
